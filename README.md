# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the Amazon Vine program which is a paid program. The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are required to publish a review. 

# Results

* There were 82 Vine (paid) reviews and 24,742 non-Vine reviews. 
* There were 33 5-star Vine reviews and 12,801 5-star non-Vine reviews.
* 40.24% of Vine reviews were 5-star and 51.76% of non-Vine reviews were 5-star. 

# Summary 

In summary, there were 27,014 total reviews posted on the site, while 13,066 of the reviews were 5-star reviews. Additionally, the findings show 40.24% of Vine reviews and 51.76% of non-Vine reviews as 5-star. These numbers shows an almost even split between 5-star reviews and all other reviews for both Vine and non-Vine members. Therefore, there does not seem to be any bias for reviews through the Vine program.
